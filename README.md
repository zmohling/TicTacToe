# Tic-Tac-Toe

A java implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. I used this short project as an introduction to two key java GUI toolkits, [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html) and [AWT](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html).
