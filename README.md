# Tic-Tac-Toe

A java implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. I used this short project as an introduction to Git Bash and two key java GUI toolkits, [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html) and [AWT](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html). To play the game, simply download [Tic-Tac-Toe.jar](https://github.com/zmohling/TicTacToe/raw/master/Tic-Tac-Toe.jar)
